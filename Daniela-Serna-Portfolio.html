        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I have a background in arts administration and currently work at two arts nonprofits: <a href="https://www.opensignalpdx.org">Open Signal (formerly Portland Community Media)</a> as engagement coordinator and <a href="https://www.s1portland.com">S1</a> as curator and facilitator. My focus is creating avenues of access for all to engage with creativity, particularly historically marginalized and underrepresented populations.</p>
          <p>I am currently a student through the <strong>Epicodus</strong> <strong><em><a href="https://www.epicodus.com/intro-to-programming">Intro to Programming</a></em></strong> course. I chose to take this course to bolster my skills and find a job that will merge my programming skills and my arts administration background.</p>
          <p>In my free time I also work as DJ, and am currently a resident at Club Culo and Club Tropicana. My sound can be described as diasporic club, bringing together the sounds of the global underground. My mixes can be found on my <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/danielakarina">Soundcloud</a>.
